## Context and Problem Statement

To communicate fast and effective we use pattern in our descriptions.
There are several pattern catalogs out there.

## Considered Options

* [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/java)
* [Enterprise Integration Paterns](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/toc.html)
* [Martin Fowlers Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/)

## Decision Outcome

I chose to use Refactoring Guru and Enterprise Integration Paterns as my favoured pattern catalogs.
