## 5.7 API Definition

Since the [→ 5.2 Implementation](/05_building_blocks/02_implementation/) and the [→ 5.3 Mock Implementation](/05_building_blocks/03_mock_implementation/) both implement the same interfaces and use the same data model, the API Definition sub project is a technical building block containing the data model and the API definition of the KP-STATUS service.
